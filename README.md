# hIndex
Get a graphical representation of the h Index over the years for a given author.

This R-package is motivated by the reading of [How does a scientist's h-index change over time?] (https://jeffollerton.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/how-does-a-scientists-h-index-change-over-time/), 
by the Professor of Biodiversity in the Department of Environmental and Geographical Sciences at the University of Northampton, **Jeff Ollertons**. It is a great post and I highly recommend it.

By using the R-package you will be able to: 
* observe how your h-index has changed over your career time
* compare your h-index change with others scientists'change 
* estimate how long it takes on average to get 1 citation (from publication date to present) for your most highly accessed papers.
