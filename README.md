# hIndex
Get a graphical representation of the h Index over the years for a given author.

This R-package is motivated by the reading of [How does a scientist's h-index change over time?](https://jeffollerton.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/how-does-a-scientists-h-index-change-over-time/), 
by  **Jeff Ollertons**, Professor of Biodiversity in the Department of Environmental and Geographical Sciences at the University of Northampton. It is a great post and I highly recommend it.

By using the R-package you will be able to:  
  * observe how your h-index has changed over your career time  
  * compare your h-index change with others scientists'change   
  * estimate how long it takes on average to get 1 citation for your most highly accessed papers (from publication date to present).
